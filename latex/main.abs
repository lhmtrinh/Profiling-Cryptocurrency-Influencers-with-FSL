In the era of social media, the impact of social content can be massive, especially when cryptocurrency investors rely on peer advises. The crypto market has been shown to be volatile, and certain social media users have a stronger influence in the market through their social media posts than others. In this paper, we aim to classify the social media based cryptocurrency influencers into categories depicting their influence in the crypto market based on their English tweets. The task is performed under low resource setting due to limited data availability, and is done using fine tuning approaches for few shot learning. We fine tune various large language models including Bert, Roberta and Electra. We additionally fine tune a combination of models to create ensemble models to take advantages of multiple pre-trained models for our classification task. We find that the ensemble models provide better test accuracy than the single models for few shot learning tasks.
